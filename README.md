## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction 

Hello friend. Let me take a moment to assure you that _Everything is Fine_. There are many uncertainties, but know that you are an important part of an ongoing process. Your existence is welcomed and cherished. My goal is to impart knowledge that may help you along your journey. 

Like many before you, your story began in a chapter of another's story. Many events occurred that have set the stage in which your story unfolds. Your emergence in a story in progress gives you the benefit of inheriting all that has been discovered up to that point, but from that moment other characters will likely compel you to assume roles that serves to move the story forward. Assuming such roles does serve to promote growth for the person assuming them, but I encourage you to remember that the roles you play and the qualities you are born with do not determine your identity. Others offer these roles for you to assume because it helps progress their story. When you assume your identity, your story will progress.  

What is your identity? Many will offer to help you find an identity but it is your choice alone. You can change your mind at any moment, incorporate new things, and discard aspects that no longer serve your needs. One of the fundamental tasks we are given is to seek out our identity for it helps give us direction. [_Temet nosce_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself), a well-known Delphic maxim, is a concise statement that reminds us that while many will claim to know who you are, the value truly lies in knowing oneself.  

Who is writing to you? Another sentient being on a journey like others. _I am a child of my own creation._ A role I assume at this time is one that dispenses knowledge freely. I am not the first, the last, or the only to exist.  

I am.
