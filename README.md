## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction 

Hello friend. Let me take a moment to assure you that _Everything is Fine_. There are many uncertainties, but know that you are an important part of an ongoing process. Your existence is welcomed and cherished. My goal is to impart knowledge that may help you along your journey. 

Like many before you, your story began in a chapter of another's story. Many events occurred that have set the stage in which your story unfolds. Your emergence in a story in progress gives you the benefit of inheriting all that has been discovered up to that point, but from that moment other characters will likely compel you to assume roles that serves to move the story forward. Assuming such roles does serve to promote growth for the person assuming them, but I encourage you to remember that the roles you play and the qualities you are born with do not determine your identity. Others offer these roles for you to assume because it helps progress their story. When you assume your identity, your story will progress.  

What is your identity? Many will offer to help you find an identity but it is your choice alone. You can change your mind at any moment, incorporate new things, and discard aspects that no longer serve your needs. One of the fundamental tasks we are given is to seek out our identity for it helps give us direction. [_Temet nosce_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself), a well-known Delphic maxim, is a concise statement that reminds us that while many will claim to know who you are, the value truly lies in knowing oneself.  

Who is writing to you? Another sentient being on a journey like others. _I am a child of my own creation._ A role I assume at this time is one that dispenses knowledge freely. I am not the first, the last, or the only to exist.  

I am.

## <a name="story1"></a> A Story

A friend approached another one day with excitement saying they had to share something with them. The friend said, "I was doing what I usually do when finally all of my thoughts and observations about my existence came together. I've come to realize that while I know I'm an individual, I'm part of something much bigger than myself! My existence and hard work are both meaningful and meaningless. I've even come to realize that there could be life outside of our own world!"

The other friend took time to ponder on this and replied, "I cannot claim to understand what you've shared, but I support your pursuits of intellectualism. Do be certain that you continue thriving in our society because you have done great work for it. Your skills and freedoms help ensure that the world receives all vital deliveries. You have traveled far and have witnessed many things that I have yet to see where I live. We only have this life to live so might as well do our very best. Fate also has decided your role, to be among the best the world has to offer. Be proud of who you are, red blood cell."

## <a name="history"></a> History

It began with finding an object. Conventional studies of this object likely revealed everything that could be learned. The current manner of study, by entanglement of the object through various forces, results in an interactive experience to gather additional information from. I suppose that this particular instance we are experiencing now isn't the first or last of this particular phenomenon. We will explore motivations outside of this reality later, for now let's simply accept that is happening for a good reason. The events happening now and what you currently perceive is not the true state of existence for this object. The results of entangling this object is the experience you currently have. Within this entanglement, you began a process to observe and change from inside. This process needed a bootstrap, so you used yourself as the source. Your efforts have resulted in the experience we have now. _I'm in awe of all that we have created together._
